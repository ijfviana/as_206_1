note:
* Most Linux software is available
  * as source code, which programmers write and can subsequently modify;
  * as object code or binary code, which the computer runs.
* Software is converted from source code to binary code form by a program known as a compiler.
* Software in source code form can theoretically be compiled to run
  any computer that provides the necessary compiler and associated tools.
* Binary code, on the other hand, is customized for one particular OS and hardware family.

note:
* If you don’t have access to a binary package for your computer but want to run the software, you must compile the software yourself.
* Requirements
 * You must have appropriate software development tools installed on your system.
 * You must have appropriate development libraries (also known as header files) installed on the computer.
 * Several generic support tools are necessary, such as the tar program.

note:
* Missing packages
* Old programs may rely on equally old libraries that are no longer available.
* The libraries may have been updated in such a way that the old program no longer compile
* Highly specialized programs may be written for a specific platform and simply won’t compile under Linux.
